      <p class="info-header">What's a Tabletop Roleplaying Game?</p>
      <p>
        A tabletop roleplaying game, or TTRPG, is a collaborative storytelling game. 
        Each of you takes on the of one of the protagonists of the story.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of you is the Gamemaster. As Gamemaster, your job is to present the players with people 
        and obstacles that the players will need to deal with to accomplish their goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a player, you describe how you'd like to react to the problems they're faced with. 
        If there's a chance your action could fail, you'll roll some dice to see what happens, 
        and that's where the <a href="/pages/rulebook.html">rules</a> come in.
      </p>

    <div class="info">
      <p class="info-header">Shenan-Again</p>
      <p>Shenan-Again is a game of controlled chaos. You and your friends take on the role of a crew of thieves attempting 
        to pull off a difficult heist using a Coil, an alien machine that warps time. 
        You'll enjoy thrilling success, and face crushing—but often hilarious—failure. </p>
        <p>
          In the end, Shenan-Again is a game about taking risks and learning from mistakes. It's about second (and third) chances. 
        See, Shenan-Again isn't just a heist story. It's a time-loop heist story.</p> 
        <p>In Shenan-Again, you relive the same heist three times, giving you three chances to get it right. 
        The second and third time around, you'll already know a lot of what's going on, 
        letting you to perfect your plan. 
        </p>

      <p class="info-header">Our Origin Story</p>
      <p>Shenan-Again began as a way for a group of friends to play a fun, light TTRPG with mininmal prep time.</p>
      <p>I asked my players what sort of game they'd like to play for a one-off, and the most popular choices were a heist game and a time-loop game. One of my players responded, "Well, why not both?"
      </p>
      <p>And I thought, "That sounds wild—let's give it a go!" And so Shenan-Again was born.</p>
      <p>It's been a crazy journey up to this point, and I'm sure it will continue to be. We're thrilled to be getting Shenan-Again out of our heads and onto your table!</p>
